# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tywin-kalandyk-a68374309/">Tywin Kalandyk</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio

I focus on cybersecurity through hands-on, practical projects that simulate real-world security operations. My work centers on vulnerability management, threat detection, and security monitoring, with an emphasis on understanding how attacks occur and how defenders identify, analyze, and respond to them.

## Vulnerability Management Projects

  - Identified and categorized system vulnerabilities using structured assessment methodologies  
  - Prioritized remediation efforts based on risk, severity, and potential impact  
  - Documented findings, remediation steps, and security improvements

- **[Programmatic Vulnerability Remediations (PowerShell and Bash)](https://github.com/tkalandyk/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-)**  
  - Automated vulnerability remediation tasks using PowerShell and Bash  
  - Reduced manual intervention by scripting repeatable security actions  
  - Improved consistency and efficiency in remediation workflows
